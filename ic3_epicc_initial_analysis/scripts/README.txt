We ran IC3 and Epicc on the DroidBench apps that contained inter-component communication.
Their execution times and outputs were consolidated and then compared.

# Steps

  - run the 'download-deps.sh' script:

      ./download-deps.sh

  - run the './run_experiments.sh' script:

      ./run_experiments.sh [--sequential] [-a apks_folder]

  The results (execution time, console output and output files) of the executions will be under the 'results' folder.

  # TODO
  The results will also be consolidated in a spreadsheet under '...'.
